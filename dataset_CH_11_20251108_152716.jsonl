Description: The Regional Groundwater Management project addresses critical issues of water scarcity, overexploitation, and pollution of groundwater in Central Asia. Groundwater is essential for agriculture, domestic use, and industrial activities, especially in water-scarce areas, where it fulfils a significant share of water demand.
